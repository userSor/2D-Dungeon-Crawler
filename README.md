# 2D Dungeon Crawler (Android Game)



A 2D dungeon crawler game built for Android as a semester-long project for Georgia Tech's CS 2340 class. Our 5-person team used Agile methodologies and object-oriented principles to build a complete, playable game from scratch.

**Note:** _The source code for this project is hosted on a **private university repository** to comply with Georgia Tech's Academic Integrity Policy._


## Tech Stack & Principles

* **Language:** Java
* **Platform:** Android Studio
* **UI / Layouts:** XML
* **Architecture:** Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
* **Design Principles:** SOLID, GRASP, Singleton Pattern
* **Testing:** JUnit
* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **Assets**: [Free Tileset on Itch.io](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii)

## Key Features

* Real-time player movement and combat.
* Multiple enemy types with basic follow.
* Collectible power-ups and weapons.
* Multi-screen game flow (start menu, main game, game over/win screens).
* Custom-designed, tile-based levels.


## My Role & Contributions

As the **Team Lead**, I was responsible for coordinating our Agile workflow. This included leading weekly sprint planning meetings, breaking down features into actionable tasks, and managing our product backlog.

My main technical contributions included:

* **Architecture:** I organized our code into the **MVVM** pattern to cleanly separate our game logic (Model) from our Android UI (View), which made debugging and scaling our features significantly easier.
* **Core Development:** Architected the class diagrams for all game entities and built the core game systems, including the scalable **tile-rendering engine**, **collision logic**, and enemy **player-chasing mechanics**.
* **Technical Leadership & DevOps:** I managed our team's **GitHub repository**, established our branching strategy, and resolved all complex merge conflicts. I led multiple pair-programming sessions to help teammates debug integration errors, screen rendering bugs, and animation issues.
